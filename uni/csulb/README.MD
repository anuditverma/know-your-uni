## FAQs.
#### 1. Why CSULB?
  - The curriculum is decent at Long Beach and is not hectic so you get a lot of time to hone your skills to get industry-ready. If you’re on a budget and getting into the industry is your main goal LB is a good choice.
The only drawback here is that you don’t have a co-op. So you only have the summer where you can intern. 

#### 2. When can I apply for part-time jobs on campus and what are the available roles where I can get that information?
  - You can apply whenever you find an open position, talk to fellow students, cold email professors. Generally, you get an email from CareerLink that has information about available on-campus jobs. But relying just on that may not guarantee an on-campus job so better would be networking + cold-emailing professors. 


#### 3. What is the living cost in Long Beach around CSULB? What is the average living expense of LB (rent +utilities +groceries) and how's the neighbourhood safety-wise?
  - If you’re planning to live off-campus you’ll generally share a 2bhk house with 4-5 other students. Everything is accessible and available. A 2bhk costs $3000. And depending upon how many of you share your rent can vary. Rent is around $600 per person if you’re 5 living in a 2bhk plus $50 per person utilities and groceries around $100 if you manage well. And since a lot of students live off-campus in apartments near to the university there is a good security arrangement. 

#### 4. Are there any groups that I can join for house hunting and other information?
  - Facebook has various groups just searching for Long Beach housing.  

#### 5. How are the Jobs and Internships opportunities?
  - Internship and job opportunities are as good as any other decent university. There won’t be any assistance from the university, you have to scout and apply for opportunities yourself. 

#### 6. What is the total fee for 2 years of MS CS for international students.
  - $33000 per year as per your I20 (this includes living + tuition estimate). In total, the cost should be around ~$30000 just for tuition if you take 3 subjects for the first 3 semesters (each sem will cost ~$7700) and for the last semester 1 subject only (which will cost ~$4000). Alternatively, if you take a course in the summer it will cost half the price of the typical last semester fee.

#### 7. To apply at CSU, do I need to courier my transcripts in a sealed envelope or can I upload them on the online portal?
  - Initially, you have to upload them to the CSU application system. Later on, they’ll email you asking for it either via post or email. So it’s good to have them prepared.
