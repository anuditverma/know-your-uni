## FAQs.
#### 1. Why CSULB?
  - The curriculum at Cal State Long Beach is quite a decent one and it is not much hectic so you get a lot of time to hone your skills to get yourself industry-ready. If you’re on a budget and getting into the industry is your main goal then CSULB is a good option. The only drawback here is that they do not have a co-op. So you only have the summers and winters when you have the time to intern. 

#### 2. When can I apply for part-time jobs on campus and what are the available roles and where I can get this information?
  - You can apply any time and whenever you find an open position, talk to fellow students and try to reach out to professors through emails. Generally, you get an email from CSULB's CareerLink platform that has information about available on-campus jobs when you register on it. But solely relying on the platform may not guarantee an on-campus job. So try to increase your network while you can to get more opportunities. You can start the network building exercise and look for a job even before you land in the States. 

#### 3. What is the living cost in Long Beach around CSULB? What is the average living expense in Long Beach (including rent, utility and groceries)? Is the neighbourhood a safe space?
  - If you’re planning to live off-campus you will generally share a 2 Bedroom 1 Bath or 2 Bath (2B2B) house with 4 or 5 other students. Everything is easily accessible and available and mostly within walking distance from your apartment. A 2B2B costs around $3000. And depending upon how you plan to live with a group or not your rent may vary. Usually, the rent is around $600 per individual if you’re 5 students living in a 2B2B apartment including approximately $50 per occupant on utility charges. Groceries for a month are around $100 and if you manage well you can save more. And since a lot of students live off-campus in apartments near to the university there is a good security arrangement provided by the apartment community.

#### 4. Are there any groups that I can join for house hunting and other information?
  - Facebook can be a go-to platform and has various groups of housing groups. You can search for Long Beach housing. 

#### 5. How are the Jobs and Internships opportunities?
  - Internship and job opportunities are as good as any other State or Private university. University can provide assistance on peer to peer resume reviews and help you with your soft skills. But ultimately you have to scout and apply for opportunities yourself. Leverage your LinkedIn network a lot when in States.

#### 6. What is the total fee for 2 years of MS CS for international students.
  - It is around $33000 per year as per your I-20  (includes living + tuition estimate). In total, the cost should be around ~$30000 just for tuition if you take 3 courses for the first 3 semesters (each sem will cost ~$7700) and for the last semester if you take 1 course only (which will cost ~$4000). Alternatively, if you take a course in the summer it will cost half the price of the typical last semester fee.

#### 7. To apply at CSU, do I need to courier my transcripts in a sealed envelope or can I upload them on the online portal?
  - Initially, you have to upload them to the CSU application system. Later in the application process, they’ll email you asking for it either via physical mail (Post) or email. So a small heads-up, better have them prepared and ready to ship.
